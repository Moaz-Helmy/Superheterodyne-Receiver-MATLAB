# Superheterodyne-Receiver-MATLAB
> Implemented a Super Heterodyne Receiver using **MATLAB**, where audio signals were up converted
to a certain frequency, then filtered and down converted to an intermediate frequency to reduce flicker
noise effect. After that, the signals are demodulated and received at the baseband.
